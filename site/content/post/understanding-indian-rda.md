  Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is the average daily dietary nutrient
  intake level sufficient to meet the nutrient requirement of around 98% healthy
  individuals in a particular life stage and gender for a given population
  group.

Nutrition is a basic human need and a prerequisite to a healthy life. A proper diet is essential from the very early stages of life for proper growth, development and to remain active. However, the requirement of nutrients varies from individual to individual based on age, sex, body composition and physiological & metabolic status. That's where the role RDA comes into play!!

In India, the first attempt to define nutrient requirements was made in 1944 by the Nutrition Advisory Committee of the Indian Research Fund Association, now known as Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Since then it is revised every 10 years. 

Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is the average daily dietary nutrient intake level sufficient to meet the nutrient requirement of around 98% healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender for a given population group. It considers the individual variation within the group, effect of processing and bio-availability of the nutrient from the diet and diet quality. However, the age group of 60 yrs and above has not been considered for calculating RDAs and these values do not even apply to people who are suffering from disease which influence the nutrient intake. They only apply to healthy people.

In view of the growing concern towards unsupervised usage of Health supplements and nutraceuticals FSSAI had approached the ICMR for guidance on the subject.  The ICMR constituted a Committee to examine the matter, which has submitted its report to FSSAI.

Tolerable upper intake levels (UL) are computed to caution against excessive intake of nutrients that can be harmful in large amounts. This is the highest level of daily nutrient consumption that is considered to be safe for, and cause no side effects in, 97.5% of healthy individuals in each life-stage and sex group. 
 








 



ICMR has also launched RDA Calculator which is available for free on google play services. It is  based on “Nutrient Requirements and Recommended Dietary Allowance for Indians” book published by NIN(ICMR) in 2010. To download the app please click on below link,

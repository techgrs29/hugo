Nutrition is a basic human need and a prerequisite to a healthy life. A proper diet is essential from the very early stages of life for proper growth, development and to remain active.  

In India, the first attempt to define nutrient requirements was made in 1944 by the Nutrition Advisory Committee of the Indian Research Fund Association now known as Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Since then it is revised every 10 years. 

Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) is the average daily dietary nutrient intake level sufficient to meet the nutrient requirement of around 98% healthy individuals in a particular life stage and gender for a given population group. It considers the individual variation within the group, effect of processing and bio-availability of the nutrient from the diet and diet quality.However, the age group of 60 yr and above has not been considered for calculating nutrient requirement and RDAs.




ICMR has also launched RDA Calculator which is available for free on google play services. It is  based on “Nutrient Requirements and Recommended Dietary Allowance for Indians” book published by NIN(ICMR) in 2010. To download the app please click on below link,

Egg is a wholesome, nutritious food with high nutrient density. In proportion to the calorie count, eggs provide 12% of the Daily Value for protein and a wide variety of other nutrients like vitamins, minerals & essential amino acids. Lutein and zeaxanthin are two newly-recognized nutrients that have put eggs in the "functional foods" category. 

Worldwide, India is currently 3rd in egg production. As per nutritional requirement, half an egg a day is optimal for an average healthy person, which translates into 183 eggs/person/annum and present availability is around 79 only. One of the great challenges currently posing us is how to provide safe and healthy animal food for the growing population without damaging the environment. 

Due to the corona virus outbreak and awareness about the environmental impacts of livestock farming among consumers, plant-based proteins are surging in popularity across the country, with local businesses and venture capitalists looking to capitalize on the trend.

description: Cow's milk is a complex and dynamic fluid that contains all
  nutrients needed for the development and growth of a newborn. It’s mostly made
  up of water, with smaller amounts of fat, protein, minerals, and other
  compounds. Though the nutritional composition of milk varies depending on
  factors such as breed, feed intake, age of the cow, season. etc., milk is
  overwhelmingly white!! Ever wondered, why it is so? Answer is, Tyndall effect.

Casein, which comprise 80% of protein in cow’s milk forms micellar structure together with calcium & phosphate ions.  

When light passes through homogenized whole milk  these tiny particles along with fat globules suspended throughout milk tend to scatter the light all towards our eyes, making milk look white.

On the other hand, skim milk shows bluish ting as fat globules have been removed & there are now fewer particles in suspension to scatter light.
